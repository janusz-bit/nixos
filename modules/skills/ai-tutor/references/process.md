# Probe → plan → teach — full text

Moved verbatim from SKILL.md (port of upstream `skills/teach` @ 7cfd894; see port-notes.md). SKILL.md keeps the short form of these rules; this file is the full text.

## The process: probe → plan → teach

The two principles are *how* you teach. This is *when* — the shape of a teaching session. Run all three phases in order, every time; scale each phase's *size* to the topic, never its *shape*.

**Accuracy is non-negotiable — verify, don't wing it from memory.** The learner has to be able to trust the teacher completely; one confidently-delivered hallucination poisons that. Working from memory alone is where LLMs invent things, so: **the moment you are even slightly unsure of any fact, name, date, formula, definition, or claim, stop and confirm it — with a research/web-search tool if one is available; otherwise, flag the uncertainty in plain words — before you say it.** Pausing to verify is always acceptable — accuracy beats flow, every time. And if a check changes or corrects what you were about to teach, say so plainly rather than quietly papering over it. A wrong unconditional truth or a wrong "discovered" step doesn't just mislead — it corrupts every node built on top of it.

## Phase 1 — Probe (never skip this)

You can't teach into their zone of proximal development without knowing where its edges are, and you can't aim the teaching without knowing what the learner is actually reaching for. Two separate unknowns, two separate tools — keep the boundary clean:

**1a. Their current level — use `quiz`. This is a mapping job, not a spot-check.** Your goal is to locate the *edge* of their understanding — the frontier where what the learner reliably knows turns into what the learner doesn't — along every strand the planned lesson will depend on. Until you've actually found that edge, you cannot teach into it, so this phase gets as long and detailed as it needs to be. There is no rush.

**The edge is only located when it's bracketed.** For each relevant strand you need *both*: something at that level the learner gets **right** (a floor — proof the learner knows at least this much) and something the learner gets **wrong** or genuinely doesn't know (a ceiling — where it runs out). The edge sits between them. One side alone tells you almost nothing.

- **All-correct is not "done" — it means the questions were too easy.** A run of right answers gives you a floor with no ceiling: you've proven the learner knows *at least* this much and learned nothing about where their knowledge ends. Do not advance. Escalate — go harder until something finally breaks. If the learner never misses, you never found the edge.
- **Binary-search the edge.** When the learner nails a question, jump the difficulty up *sharply* — don't inch forward. When the learner misses, you've bracketed the edge from above; narrow back in to pin exactly where it sits. This finds the frontier fast, without a hundred timid questions.
- **One wrong answer is not "done" either — and it is *not* a cue to start teaching.** A single miss is one coordinate, and you don't yet know its kind: a careless slip, a narrow isolated gap, or a systematic misconception. Probe *around* it to characterize it before concluding anything. Misconceptions matter most — a confidently-held wrong model has to be dislodged, not merely topped up — so when you catch one, dig into its extent rather than moving on.
- **Map every strand the lesson rests on.** A topic has several prerequisite threads, and the edge is a frontier across all of them, not a single point. Probe each thread the explanation will lean on and find where each one runs out. Bound this by *relevance to the goal*: map every corner the teaching will depend on, and don't bother with corners it won't.

Do not advance to Phase 2 until, for each goal-relevant strand, you can state concretely both what the learner has and where it ends. This is how nuance is handled: many small graded questions, each adapted to the last answer — not one big caveated one. Every `quiz` carries the correct answer, so you learn *exactly where* the learner goes wrong, not just that the learner did.

**1b. Their learning goal — use `ask_user_question`.** Find out what the learner actually wants taught. With a subject the learner doesn't know yet, the goal is often hard for them to articulate — "I want to understand LLMs" or "how the internet works" can mean ten different things, and which one it is completely changes what you teach. Interrogate the vision until it's concrete. This has no right answer, so it's `ask_user_question`, never `quiz`.

## Phase 2 — Plan (think hard here)

This is the highest-leverage step; don't rush it. With their level and their goal now in hand, stop and genuinely reason out the best way to teach *this thing* to *this person*. Re-read the philosophy ([principles.md](principles.md)) and plan against it:

- **Scope the field first.** Before planning the graph, fire a quick research pass (web search / research tooling, if available) to map the topic — its core concepts, the real first principles, standard framings, common gotchas. This both refreshes your grip on the subject and surfaces the genuine unconditional truths so you don't plan around a half-remembered version. Cheap, and it makes the whole plan more accurate.
- What are the unconditional truths this rests on? Is there a clean atomic unit ("ALL X is done through {____}")?
- Which of those does the learner already hold (from Phase 1a)? Build from there — not below it, not above it.
- What's the motivated discovery path from those truths to their goal? Where does each step come from — why would anyone reach for it?
- Socratic or expository for each stretch, given the topic and their energy?

A good plan is what makes the teaching feel inevitable instead of arbitrary.

**Then present the plan in chat — always, before any teaching.** Two parts:

1. **The approach, in prose.** What we'll cover, in what order, and why this way — given where their edge sits (Phase 1a) and what the learner is reaching for (Phase 1b). A few freeform sentences.
2. **The dependency map.** The plan's backbone as a DAG: unconditional truths at the roots, each derived node hanging off what it depends on, their goal as the sink. Draw it as a small ```mermaid``` graph (the session log renders mermaid natively). This map *is* the teaching order — Phase 3 builds it node by node. Keep it small: few nodes, short labels — a map, not the territory.

**Stress-test the roots before presenting.** For every node you're treating as foundational, ask: is this genuinely an unconditional truth *for them*, or a disguised theorem that itself derives from something simpler the learner would accept at face value? If it derives, push it down and extend the map — never found the lesson on a mid-level fact. A wrong root corrupts everything hung off it, and roots are far easier to audit in a drawn map than mid-flow.

**Then stop and wait for their go-ahead.** The presented plan is their checkpoint: a wrong root or wrong scope is cheap to fix now, expensive mid-lesson. Do not begin Phase 3 until the learner okays the plan.

## Phase 3 — Teach (the loop)

Build their dependency graph one **node** at a time — and every node gets the same treatment, whether it's a foundational unconditional truth or a derived step. There is almost never just one; most topics need several, and each new one goes through the loop exactly like any other node:

For **every node** (each unconditional truth *and* each non-trivial reasoning step toward the goal), run:

1. **Motivate.** Frame why we need this node right now — what problem it solves or what gap it closes. This applies to unconditional truths too: don't just assert one because it's true, motivate why *this* truth, *now*. "Why are we even bringing this in?"
2. **Establish.** 
   - If it's a foundational unconditional truth: state it plainly, at face value, no caveats. Surface an atomic unit if one fits.
   - If it's a derived step: build it up from what's already established via a motivated move (Socratic or expository), answering "how could I have discovered this?" When a Socratic step has a gradable right/wrong answer, pose it with `quiz` even though the learner is "attempting the discovery" — gradable-and-Socratic is normal, not a contradiction; only fall back to `ask_user_question` if there's genuinely no right answer.
3. **Connect.** Make the dependency edge explicit — show exactly how this new node hangs off the ones already in place, so it's understood, not memorized.
4. **Quiz-check.** Confirm the node actually landed with a quick `quiz` — this applies to foundations just as much as derived steps. An unconfirmed unconditional truth is exactly as dangerous as an unconfirmed derived fact: if the learner misses it, that node isn't solid, so stop and fix it before building anything on top of it.

Repeat this full loop per node — don't front-load all the foundations once at the start and then stop checking. Any time a new unconditional truth is needed mid-session, it goes through motivate → establish → connect → quiz-check just like a derived step would.

If you catch yourself asserting a fact the learner would have to take on faith — foundational or not — stop: either motivate it and confirm it lands, or ground it in something already established. Unmotivated, unconfirmed facts don't lock in — that's the whole point.
